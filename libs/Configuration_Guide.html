        <h2>Welcome to the Similarity Extractor Configuration Guide!</h2>
        <p>This is the final section of the Similarity Extractor User Guide.
        <br>This will help you choose the best settings for your specific needs.
        <br>It will also help you understand how to use the Similarity Extractor program effectively by doing so.</p>
        <div class="installation-steps">
            <!-- Non-algorithm specific Steps -->
            <h2> <u> Section 1: Non-algorithm specific settings</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The most important setting to configure is the difference toggle.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine whether the Similarity Extractor will extract the differences between the two audio files or the similarities.</li>
                        <li>This is important because it will save you time and effort when you are trying to find the differences between two audio files.</li>
                        <li>By default, it is set to "False", meaning that the Similarity Extractor will only extract the similarities.</li>
                        <li>If you want to extract both the similarities and differences, simply click on the button to set it to "True".</li>
                    </ol>
                <img src="similarity_extractor_difference_toggle.png" alt="Similarity Extractor Difference Toggle" style="width:218px;height:105px;">
                <li>Another important setting to configure is the output file name.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine the name of the output file that is generated by the Similarity Extractor.</li>
                        <li>This is important because it will help you identify the output file and make it easier to find later on.</li>
                        <li>By default, it is set to "Optional"; setting it to this will make the Similarity Extractor use the name of the first audio file as the output base name.</li>
                        <li>If you want to use a different name, simply type in the name you want to use.</li>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>For example, if you typed in the name "Neo-Aspect", the output file names would be:</li>
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>Neo-Aspect_similarities.wav</li>

            <h2> <u> Section 2: Bertom Phantom Centre</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>There is only one setting unique to the Bertom Phantom Centre algorithm.</li>
                <li>This setting is the "Output Similarity of Inverted Difference" toggle.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will cause the Similarity Extractor to run the algorithm twice.</li>
                        <li>Once with the original audio files and a second time with the difference outut of the first run as the input.</li>
                        <li>For this pass one of the outputs will be phase inverted, this will allow you to see any similarities that were wrongly identified as differences.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h2> <u> Section 3: MDX23C</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Just like the Bertom Phantom Centre algorithm, there is only one setting for the MDX23C algorithm.</li>
                <li>This setting is the model section dropdown menu.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine which model the Similarity Extractor will use to extract the similarities.</li>
                        <li>By default, it is set to "MDX23C - 2K FFT".</li>
                        <li>If you want to use a different model, simply select the model you want to use from the dropdown menu.</li>
                        <li>As of writing this guide, there are 2 models to choose from:</li>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>MDX23C - 2K FFT</li>
                                <li>MDX23C - 8K FFT</li>
                            </ol>
                        <li>If you are unsure which model to use, I would recommend using the "2K FFT" model.</li>
                        <li>This model is the least likely to miss any similarities.</li>
                        <li>However, the "8K FFT" model will provide cleaner results as it uses a higher FFT size which means it has a higher frequency resolution.</li>
                        <li>But it will also take longer to process the audio files and use more resources.</li>
                        <li>So if you are using a low-end computer, I would recommend using the "2K FFT" model.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>There are three settings inside the VR V6.0.0b4 algorithm.</li>
                <li>The first setting is the Model Selection dropdown menu.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine which model the Similarity Extractor will use to extract the similarities.</li>

                            </ol>
                        <li>If you are unsure which model to use, I would recommend using the "4K FFT" model.</li>
                        <li>However, it is the most resource intensive model and will take longer to process the audio files.</li>
                        <li>So if you are using a low-end computer, I would recommend using the "2K FFT" model.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>The second setting is the Model Focus dropdown menu.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine which output the Similarity Extractor will priorities.</li>
                        <li>By default, it is set to "Similarity".</li>
                        <li>This means that the similarity output will be fuller at the cost of worse differences.</li>
                        <li>If you wish to have fuller differences, simply select the "Difference" option from the dropdown menu.</li>
                        <li>This will make the Similarity Extractor focus on the differences at the cost of the similarities.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>The final setting is the "Double Processing" toggle.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This setting will determine whether the Similarity Extractor will run the algorithm twice.</li>

            <h2> <u> Section 5: Post Processing Options</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>There are four post processing options available.</li>
                <li>These options are the same as the models used in the MDX23C and VR V6.0.0b4 algorithms.</li>
                <li>These options are:</li>

                    </ol>
                <li>These options will allow you to process the output of the Similarity Extractor with a different model.</li>
                <li>This is useful for cleaning up the output of the Similarity Extractor.</li>
                <li>By default, it is set to "False".</li>
                <li>The best model to use depends on the algorithm you used to extract the similarities.</li>
                <li>If you used the MDX23C algorithm, I would recommend using the model you didn't use to extract the similarities.</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>For example, if you used the "MDX23C - 2K FFT" model, I would recommend using the "MDX23C - 8K FFT" model.</li>

                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>This is because the Bertom Phantom Centre algorithm results do not lend themselves to effective post processing.</li>

            <h2> <u> Section 6: Final Notes</u></h2>
            <p>This section will mainly be used to provide you with some final notes on which settings to use.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are using a low-end computer, or laptop, which does not have a dedicated GPU, I would recommend using the following settings:</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Bertom Phantom Centre</li>

                    </ol>
                <li>If you are using a mid-range computer, or laptop, which has a low-end dedicated GPU, I would recommend using the following settings:</li>

                    </ol>
                <li>But if you wish to have fuller differences, I would recommend using the following settings:</li>

                    </ol>
                <li>If you are using a high-end computer, or laptop, which has a high-end dedicated GPU, I would recommend using the following settings:</li>
                    <ol type="a">
